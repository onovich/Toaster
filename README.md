# Toaster
Toaster is a pathfinding mesh baking library and one of the "pathfinding trio" (the other two being the pathfinding library [Compass](https://github.com/onovich/Compass/tree/main) and the intersection detection library [Knot](https://github.com/onovich/Knot)).<br/>
**Toaster 是一个寻路网格烘焙库，是"寻路三件套"之一（另外两个是寻路库 [Compass](https://github.com/onovich/Compass/tree/main)、交叉检测库 [Knot](https://github.com/onovich/Knot)）。**

# Readiness
It is one of my early works, now seen as full of flaws, and I plan to rewrite it when I have the time.<br/>
**它是我的早期作品，现在来看充满瑕疵，有空会考虑对它重写。**

# Feature
It supports mesh subdivision, but not elegantly.<br/>
**支撑了网格细分，但不优雅。**

# Dependency
Intersection detection library [Knot](https://github.com/onovich/Knot)
